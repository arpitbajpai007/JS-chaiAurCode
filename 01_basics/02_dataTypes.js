"use strict;"
// treat all JS code as newer version. Code will be treated according to new standards in whole file by engine. Ab to automatic strict mode me chalta hai sabkuch but its a good syntax of writing.
 
// alert( 3 + 3 )
// gives error because we are talking about everything in node here but if we bind the file in html or we go into developer console, then it will give 6. We can use alert in node but it has different syntax. We are using nodejs, not browser.

console.log(3+3); // code readability should be high .
console.log("Arpit");
