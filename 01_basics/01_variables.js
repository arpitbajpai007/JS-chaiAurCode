let accountState;//if you declare a variable in javascript and don't initialise it then it is considered as undefined.

//constants can only be declared using const keyword but variables can be declared in two ways using let and var. var is no more used in javascript because it has scope problems and that's why only let is used as it has no scope probelms.

/* 
prefer not to use var
because of issue in block scope and functional scope
*/

// First Method for printing
// console.log(accountId);
// console.log(accountEmail);
// console.log(accountPassword);
// console.log(accountCity);

//second Method (generates a table)
